# AI Native Development Guide - Project Context

## Mission
Teach developers to **build reliable AI systems that code autonomously** through systematic engineering methodologies.

## Core Methodology
- **Markdown Prompt Engineering**: Structured, repeatable instructions using semantic structure and validation gates
- **Agent Primitives**: Configurable tools (`.instructions.md`, `.chatmode.md`, `.prompt.md`, `memory.md`, `.context.md` and `.spec.md`) for systematic approaches
- **Context Engineering**: Optimize AI performance through strategic memory management and session splitting
- **Multi-Agent Delegation**: Progress from single prompts to delegating complete coding tasks to GitHub Coding Agents
- **Team Governance**: Scale patterns across organizations with quality gates and compliance frameworks

## Transformation Goal
**From**: Manual AI supervision for simple tasks
**To**: Architecting autonomous AI systems that handle complex coding workflows with compound intelligence

## Status

The guide is incomplete, and needs constant refinement based on research, evolving practices and innovation.
