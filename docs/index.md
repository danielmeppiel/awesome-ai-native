## How to Use This Guide

**First Time Here?** Start with [Core Concepts](concepts/) to understand the foundational principles, then move to [Getting Started](getting-started/) for hands-on implementation.

**Want Quick Results?** Jump directly to [Getting Started](getting-started/) and return to concepts later for deeper understanding.

**Ready to Scale?** If you already use basic Agent Primitives, advance to [Workflow Orchestration](workflows/) for delegation patterns.

**Leading a Team?** Focus on [Team Adoption](team-adoption/) for organizational implementation strategies.

**Need a Quick Reference?** Use the [Reference](reference/) section for checklists and documentation links.
