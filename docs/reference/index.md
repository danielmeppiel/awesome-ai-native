Essential checklists, progression frameworks, and documentation links for ongoing AI Native Development implementation and mastery.

## Quick Start Checklist

### Conceptual Foundation
1. **[ ]** Understand **Markdown Prompt Engineering** principles (semantic structure + precision + tools)
2. **[ ]** Grasp **Context Engineering** fundamentals (buffer optimization + session strategy)

### Implementation Steps
3. **[ ]** Create [`.github/copilot-instructions.md`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_use-a-githubcopilot-instructionsmd-file) with basic project guidelines (Context Engineering: global rules)
4. **[ ]** Set up domain-specific [`.instructions.md` files](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_use-instructionsmd-files) with `applyTo` patterns (Context Engineering: selective loading)
5. **[ ]** Configure [chat modes](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_custom-chat-modes) for your tech stack domains (Context Engineering: domain boundaries)
6. **[ ]** Create first [`.prompt.md` file](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_prompt-files-experimental) with validation checkpoints (Markdown Prompt Engineering: deterministic templates)
7. **[ ]** Build your first `.spec.md` template for feature specifications (Agent Primitive: deterministic planning-to-implementation bridge)
8. **[ ]** Practice spec-first workflow: plan first, implement second (Context Engineering: session splitting)
9. **[ ]** Test async delegation with [GitHub Coding Agent](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/about-github-copilot/about-copilot-coding-agent) (Advanced orchestration)
10. **[ ]** Establish team governance and validation gates (Human-AI collaboration patterns)

**Time Investment:** 8-12 hours  
**Key Outcomes:**
- [ ] Spec-first planning methodology
- [ ] Context engineering strategies implemented
- [ ] Session splitting for complex tasks
- [ ] Memory-driven development patterns

**Next Step:** Progress to Advanced with async delegation

### Advanced Level
**Goal:** Async delegation and multi-agent orchestration  
**Time Investment:** 15-20 hours  
**Key Outcomes:**
- [ ] GitHub Coding Agent delegation working
- [ ] Parallel multi-agent workflows
- [ ] Quality gates and validation processes
- [ ] Hybrid context strategies

**Next Step:** Achieve Expert level with team implementation

### Expert Level
**Goal:** Team-wide governance and frontier pattern innovation  
**Time Investment:** 25+ hours  
**Key Outcomes:**
- [ ] Team-scale coordination frameworks
- [ ] Knowledge sharing systems
- [ ] Governance and compliance integration
- [ ] Innovation in AI Native Development patterns

**Next Step:** Contribute to community knowledge and frontier research

## The Paradigm Shift

*Traditional approach: "Tell the AI what to do"*  
**Agent Mastery approach: "Engineer the context and structure for optimal cognitive performance"**

### Core Principles
1. **Determinism through Structure:** More predictable outcomes through systematic approaches
2. **Context as Performance:** Strategic memory management for optimal AI cognitive performance
3. **Compound Intelligence:** Systems that improve through iteration and learning
4. **Human-AI Partnership:** Validation gates and collaborative workflows
5. **Team-Scale Coordination:** Knowledge sharing and organizational transformation

### Key Insights
- **The more determinism you need, the more Markdown Prompt Engineering and smaller scope you must use**
- **The more complex your project, the more Context Engineering becomes critical**
- **Master both principles and you'll achieve unprecedented consistency and quality in agent-driven development**

**Remember:** Start simple, iterate fast, scale systematically through systematic application of these frontier concepts.
