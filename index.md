## Core Mental Model

Think of AI Native Development like **professional software development practices**:

- **Markdown Prompt Engineering** = Coding standards for AI interactions
- **Agent Primitives** = Reusable libraries and configurations  
- **Context Engineering** = Memory and performance optimization

## AI Native Development Maturity

Most developers start by manually supervising every AI interaction—writing one-off prompts and starting from scratch each time. This creates a bottleneck where you're always needed for AI tasks to succeed.

**The transformation happens when you shift from supervision to architecture.** Instead of managing individual AI conversations, you engineer reusable systems that delegate entire workflows to AI agents.

This maturity journey represents the core mindset shift from reactive AI usage to proactive AI engineering:

        <li>Write one-off prompts for each task</li>

        <li>Start from scratch each time</li>
      </ul>

        <strong>You're the bottleneck</strong> - Every AI task needs your attention

      <h3>Engineered Agent Delegation</h3>
      <p class="stage-subtitle">You architect systems, AI executes</p>
      <ul class="stage-points">
        <li>Build reusable <strong>Agent Primitives</strong></li>
        <li>Engineer context once, reuse everywhere</li>
        <li>Delegate complete workflows to AI</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="stage-outcome">
        <strong>You're the architect</strong> - AI handles execution autonomously
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

> *"The future belongs to developers who can architect AI systems, not just prompt them."*

**This is frontier work.** AI Native Development is evolving rapidly, and the patterns that work today will be refined tomorrow. That's why this guide thrives on community innovation.

**Your contribution shapes the field.** Whether you discover a new Agent Primitive pattern, refine an existing workflow, or share a breakthrough insight—every contribution advances our collective understanding and gets you listed as a co-author of this evolving knowledge base.
